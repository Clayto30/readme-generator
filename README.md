# Read Me Generator

## Description 

As we all know, a great README is a key part to a great app. As such, I 
have endeavored to demonstrate my developing skills of using Node and the 
Inquirer Package to help developers use the Command Line Interface to make
their own quality read me's for their own projects. 

Check this out on my GitHub Repository, [Read Me Generator](https://github.com/Clayto30/readme-generator)

## Installation

Clone the Repo onto your local device. Have you installed node.js? You will need
that and the Inquirer Package to run this. After that, you will use the command line
to get to crafting a wonderful README 

## Usage 

Once you have cloned the Repo and have the necessary things installed, type 
"node index" into the command line when you are in the directory with the index js
file.

Follow the prompts. Take some care to input things correctly, clearly, and accurately.
This can only help you in the long run, as it will be your README! I hope you use it
well.

## Credits

As usual, I have to thank my instructors and TA's at the UC Berkeley Bootcamp.
They provide the instruction for this challenge. I couldn't even begin a project 
such as this without that vital guidance.
